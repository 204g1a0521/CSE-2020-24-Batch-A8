#Abstract
The main objective of our project is to build a cutting-edge web-based platform that dumb and deaf people from all around the globe may utilize. The translation of 
nonverbal cues and sign language into text and audio is done using modern machine learning techniques. Because of how easy it is to use, anyone can easily use the 
platform.

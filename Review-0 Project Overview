#Abstract
The main objective of our project is to build a cutting-edge web-based platform that dumb and deaf people from all around the globe may utilize. The translation of 
nonverbal cues and sign language into text and audio is done using modern machine learning techniques. Because of how easy it is to use, anyone can easily use the 
platform. 
#Problem Statement
1.Communication is important for every human being in daily life. However, people who have a hearing and speech disability need a different way to communicate with 
normal people. 
2.They use signs to communicate with each other and with others which is not understood by a lot of  people. To solve this, a machine learning model is be created. 
This model would be trained to recognize numerous sign language gestures and translate them into text and audio. This technology makes it possible to converse with 
those who are deaf and mute.
#Objectives
1.To create a web based application which converts non verbal signals to text and audio.
2.To provide user friendly environment web application where people can communicate at ease.                                           
#Literature Survey of First Objective
Generally, communication between impaired people and normal people is done through synthesized speech known as sign language.[1]
In this system, images are captured through a webcam in the website and send to the back-end then gives output in the form of text and audio.[2]
Due to the limitations of the sensors we are compelled to create a project using a website.[4]
#Literature Survey of Second Objective
The input is enhanced and pre-processed using OpenCV, which is also utilized to present the detection model’s results in real-time.[3]
Conversing the non-verbal language makes easier and more comfort for the normal people to share their ideas and thoughts.[4]
